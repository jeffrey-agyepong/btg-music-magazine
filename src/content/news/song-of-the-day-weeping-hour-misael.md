**Lyrics:**

That bird of wisdom 

Had its prey 

But I saw faith 

behind those walls 

Of green and beige 



When your cup is running dry

Why would I not just pour you mine 

That day I saw adolescence die



Blurry felt the law of the land 

When we murdered childlike eyes

World was viewed like a page

Not these ink spread shades of gray 



Just eighteen 

When your world was pulled out from under 

Oh eighteen 

When we tore your life asunder 



Did our lines of security

Become  more than life

Would I not break the bread of my birthright



Did you mourn about your future 

As we begged you to 

Hang your harps on the willow



Did we render justice

As Mother liberty held you hostage

How could he sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?

As he bore witness to all of our privilege

Born of his name

And you’ve borne yours well

I read “Hope” as you signed it “Misael”



Never had I seen 

Garments of captivity 

Appear as shrouds of pure belief 

How does one exude hope in exile



Just eighteen 

When we told you home was another 

Oh eighteen

When we cursed you, our own brother 

Did we gain by sending innocence away 



A child abroad uprooted and estranged



Did our lines of security

Become  more than life

Would I not break the bread of my birthright



Did you mourn about your future 

As we begged you to 

Hang your harps on the willow

Did we render justice

As Mother liberty held you hostage

How could he sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?

As he bore witness to all of our privilege

Born of his name

And you’ve borne yours well

I read “Hope” as you signed it “Misael”



Detained was my reason and belief

Correct my apathy

Cultivate compassion

Pardon me for the day 

That refuge became ruin
