**The Hollow Present** is a newly formed death metal project featuring David Marshall *(formerly of The Burial)* and Gabe Fry *(formerly of From the Shallows, Solace and Stable)*. After several years away from music, The Hollow Present decided that covering some classic songs would help build some momentum, starting with ZAO's "Savannah".

Here's what David Marshall had to say about the song's theme:

> "Dan Weyandt (of Zao) wrote the song about a porn star who suffered a life-altering car accident and ended up taking her own life shortly after. In our current day and age, pornography is just as rampant and widespread as ever, if not more so, and continually claims lives, both metaphorically and literally. Whereas in the past the most popular models might be both Hollywood AND adult actresses, nowadays it's less about the popularity and more about mining the depths of depravity and sin, with pornographic websites being filled with trafficking victims, not to mention underage children being taken advantage of with little to no actual vetting happening from the website's side. (Along with their continual attempts to shift blame and responsibility for allowing these videos to be distributed, and their slandering of anti-porn organizations like TraffickingHub, making them out to be villains.)
