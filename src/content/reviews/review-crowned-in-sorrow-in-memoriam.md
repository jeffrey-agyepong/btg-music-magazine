 otherwise known for this work associated with Blood Thirsty, Cosyns, 
Whisper From Heaven, and Syringe, hits the mark with his recently 
released solo project *In Memoriam* under the band name Crowned 
in Sorrow. Corzine identified this as his most personal work lyrically 
to date, dealing with loss and grief. The album finds rest in the 
comfort of life after death through faith in Jesus Christ. However, this
 is anything but a restful album, with an incredible amount of talent 
displayed by Corzine as he handles the drums, bass, mandolin, piano, 
keys, and the dominant clean/distorted vocals. A number of guest 
vocalists make an appearance as detailed below:

* DC Mills: Additional vocals on “Far Beyond Death”
* Luke Renno: Additional vocals on “We Carried Your Body”
* Courtney Johnson: Lead vocals on “Ashes”
* Hunter Routh: Outro Guitar Solo on “Slipping Away”
* Joel Goodwin: Organ on “Ashes”
* Carolina Teruel: Cello on “Ashes”

**Lyrically**,
 to title an album as such clearly indicates the direction and content. 
Corzine is no stranger to loss, losing both his sister and his father. 
The track ‘Blue to Gray’ deals with the loss of his father, and the line
 "*I remember the sky that day/How it changed from blue to gray*"
 when growled by Corzine will resonate with those who have lost someone 
close. Other tracks such as ‘Only Memories’ deal with the pain of 
addiction, yet the line ''*Disbelief overtakes me/As I pick up the phone*'' rings universal for all those who have felt the absence of a familiar voice once previously available.

**Sonically**,
 Corzine is clearly gifted given the output of this album. The gentle 
downcast, yet slightly uplifting and hopeful opening tones of the first 
track ‘Far Beyond Death’ soon delve into the heavier, slow distortion 
characteristic of the doom genre. This foreshadows the remainder of the 
album. Corzine never lets us settle too deep into despair, reducing us 
with drawn-out guitar wails reminiscent of the late nineties 
collaboration between Everlast and Santana. ‘Remembrance’ marks the 
midpoint of the album and was produced to honor Corzine’s sister after 
her passing in 2016. The instrumental both relieves and builds tension, 
before releasing us back into the depths, rescuing us once again as the 
piano version of ‘Remembrance’ is placed as the closing track.

**Overall**,
 a solid album that deserves to be treated as a performance rather than 
music for the sake of a background accompaniment. Deserving of a quiet 
room at dusk watching the evening fall, soaking in everything *In Memoriam*
 has to offer. Despite the seemingly lengthy tracks identified on paper,
 the album feels well balanced and flows evenly from start to finish.

**For fans of** Veni Domine, Type O Negative, and Impending Doom fans looking to chill.

### Rating: 10/10



**Favorite tracks:**
 ‘Ashes’ for the lilting vocals Courtney Johnson brings to offset the 
undercurrent of melodic strings and contrasting guttural growls from 
Corzine; ‘Blue to Gray’ for the diversity represented, and how the 
vocals penetrate and reach that point of grief.
