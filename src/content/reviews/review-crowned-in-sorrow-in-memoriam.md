Derek Corzine, of [Corzine Studio](https://web.archive.org/web/20210222193723/https://soundcloud.com/corzinestudio)[](https://web.archive.org/web/20210222193723/https://soundcloud.com/corzinestudio),otherwise known for this work associated with Blood Thirsty, Cosyns, Whisper From Heaven, and Syringe, hits the mark with his recently 
released solo project *In Memoriam* under the band name Crowned in Sorrow. Corzine identified this as his most personal work lyrically to date, dealing with loss and grief. The album finds rest in the comfort of life after death through faith in Jesus Christ. However, this is anything but a restful album, with an incredible amount of talent 
displayed by Corzine as he handles the drums, bass, mandolin, piano,  keys, and the dominant clean/distorted vocals. A number of guest 
vocalists make an appearance as detailed below:

* DC Mills: Additional vocals on “Far Beyond Death”
* Luke Renno: Additional vocals on “We Carried Your Body”
* Courtney Johnson: Lead vocals on “Ashes”
* Hunter Routh: Outro Guitar Solo on “Slipping Away”
* Joel Goodwin: Organ on “Ashes”
* Carolina Teruel: Cello on “Ashes”

**Lyrically**, to title an album as such clearly indicates the direction and content. 
Corzine is no stranger to loss, losing both his sister and his father. 
The track ‘Blue to Gray’ deals with the loss of his father, and the line
 "*I remember the sky that day/How it changed from blue to gray*"
 when growled by Corzine will resonate with those who have lost someone 
close. Other tracks such as ‘Only Memories’ deal with the pain of 
addiction, yet the line ''*Disbelief overtakes me/As I pick up the phone*'' rings universal for all those who have felt the absence of a familiar voice once previously available.

**Sonically**, Corzine is clearly gifted given the output of this album. The gentle 
downcast, yet slightly uplifting and hopeful opening tones of the first 
track ‘Far Beyond Death’ soon delve into the heavier, slow distortion 
characteristic of the doom genre. This foreshadows the remainder of the 
album. Corzine never lets us settle too deep into despair, reducing us 
with drawn-out guitar wails reminiscent of the late nineties 
collaboration between Everlast and Santana. ‘Remembrance’ marks the 
midpoint of the album and was produced to honor Corzine’s sister after 
her passing in 2016. The instrumental both relieves and builds tension, 
before releasing us back into the depths, rescuing us once again as the 
piano version of ‘Remembrance’ is placed as the closing track.

**Overall**, a solid album that deserves to be treated as a performance rather than 
music for the sake of a background accompaniment. Deserving of a quiet 
room at dusk watching the evening fall, soaking in everything *In Memoriam*
 has to offer. Despite the seemingly lengthy tracks identified on paper,
 the album feels well balanced and flows evenly from start to finish.

**For fans of** Veni Domine, Type O Negative, and Impending Doom fans looking to chill.

### Rating: 10/10



**Favorite tracks:** ‘Ashes’ for the lilting vocals Courtney Johnson brings to offset the 
undercurrent of melodic strings and contrasting guttural growls from 
Corzine; ‘Blue to Gray’ for the diversity represented, and how the 
vocals penetrate and reach that point of grief.






### <div style="text-align:center;">BTG Staff's Second Opinion</div>

There’s so much to say about this album. It was a very pleasant and also a very
 emotional experience to write a review about this phenomenal album. 
After I listened to the album, a few bands came to mind to compare with 
this project. Swallow the Sun from Finland and also the earlier Scar 
Symmetry. Derek’s deep grunting vocals are similar to the vocalist of 
Swallow the Sun and most of the clean vocals sounded a bit like 
Christian Alvestam of Scar Symmetry. But Crowned In Sorrow is not a copy
 cat of this band. In tempo, I think it's closer to Swallow the Sun 
because Scar Symmetry is melodic death metal with mostly a high tempo. 
But there is also a difference in the lyrics because through the lyrics 
about grief, loss, and even despair there is hope shining through in the
 person of Jesus Christ, the first song has a very great lyrical passage
 where the faith of Derek is coming through:

> *"Far beyond the reach of death,*
>
> *There is a place of pure life only*
>
> *Only to be found*
>
> *Through faith in Jesus Christ" - Far Beyond Death*

Maybe
 I am a little overreacting, but I loved this song from the moment I 
heard it. It starts with an acoustic and calm passage, which we also 
hear in the music of DC Mills (Vials of Wrath). I don’t think it's a 
coincidence that he did the high screams later in the song. This song is
 beautifully constructed. In minute 2, there is a beautiful melody that 
may be inspired by the riffs that Insomnium often produces. And it's 
great to hear those riffs quite a few times throughout this song. The 
clean vocals also have an important role in this track and they’re 
amazing! In the outro, we also hear the piano coming through.

"**Ending It All**"
 is the second song on the album. This song has a more progressive sound
 than melodic, I think mainly because of the change in tempo and bass 
lines. The grunting vocals are even lower than on the opening song. And 
the clean vocals coming in again smoothly. It has a kind of Roots of 
Tragedy vibe on it, and actually, that's not a bad thing.

The 
build-up is great in this track, the song slowly takes on a more brutal 
sound, around minute 2. The song ends with a spotless-sounding guitar 
solo.

**"Slipping Away"** is the third song on the 
album. Soon we hear a familiar riff, I think it was taken from a song of
 Whispers from Heaven. That was a gothic doom project of Derek Corzine. 
It's an excellent riff. What a wonderful ode is this track to the 
doom/death metal genre, slow and extremely heavy riffs, incredibly low 
grunts, and drums that hold back the tempo a bit, it even includes an 
acoustic passage. Well, what I have to say further? Oh wait, some very 
aggressive high-pitched screams to add to it.

**"Ashes"**
 begins calmly with a nice bass line, and then a violin is coming in. I 
was very surprised to hear the voice of a woman; I didn't see this 
coming. She has a pretty good voice, and this is a nice resting moment 
in this album where there is room for beautiful musical interludes, 
acoustic guitar, and certainly also the bass and a nice voice. Around 
minute 4 there is a pretty rough passage, which reminds me a lot of 
Paramecium.

**"Remembrance"** is an instrumental 
song, a beautiful piano interlude with a heavy guitar riff coming 
through to start a transition to the next track on the album.

**"Blue to Gray"**
 is also starting with the piano, but much darker. And the song starts 
also familiar to me but I might be wrong. The tempo in this track is 
higher, and soon we hear slightly ominous clean vocals. You are drawn to
 the various transitions in this track. At times and late, it also feels
 majestic by adding choral vocals. The epic part is a bit like what Hope
 for the Dying always brings into their songs so beautifully.

**"Only Memories"**
 starts with one of the nicest piano lines I have heard in recent times.
 Such emotional dark tunes, and soon there comes some of the most brutal
 riffs coming in this album. Soon we hear the nice clean vocals again, 
very tenor-like. This song reminds me very much of Swallow the Sun, but 
Derek sounds more progressive or even a bit djenty because of those 
breakdown-like passages coming through. The piano continues to play an 
important role in this track, again we hear a beautiful guitar solo 
coming in. There is so much variation to be heard that it will never get
 boring.

At the end of the song, even some bells are coming through after some very low grunting vocals!

Now it's time for **"We Carried Your Body"**,
 its also time for the guest role of Luke Renno from the death metal 
band Crimson Thorn, you can hear it about minute 5. Man, what a song and
 what an epic grunt he has. It's by far the most brutal track on the 
song, not only because of the vocals but also instrumental-wise. We can 
hear again some very nice tempo changes in here. We take a breath 
through an acoustic passage, then comes one of the most beautiful 
endings of songs on the entire album. What a great musician he is! The 
beautiful sound, heavy but in a way very sweet sounding.

**"Eternity Upon Your Grave"**
 was the first song he has released. this track will never get boring, 
the dreamy clean vocals, perhaps a bit or something inspired by the 
singer of Katatonia, the transition to the heavier work. Phenomenal. An 
album cannot end better than this track, not even mentioning the screams
 that come in between, as if all genres that Derek loves are brought 
together in one track. The beautiful change of tempo and also a change 
of tone around minute 4, where the screams come even more to the fore. 
What else do I have to say about this track? I end with the words, how 
grateful we can be that there are artists like Crowned in Sorrow who 
know how to use their talents to the maximum.

The outro, a beautiful piano version of **"Remembrance"**, a great way to think back to what we were presented with. A beautiful album has become In Memoriam.

### Rating: 9.5/10



**Reason:** It’s almost perfect. If you like bands like Paramecium, Roots of 
Tragedy and I also hear some Hope for the Dying coming through, because
 of the epic and orchestral elements, then you will love this. I would 
also add some secular bands like Swallow the Sun, Insomnium, or Scar 
Symmetry to the list, the last one because of the clean vocals inspired 
by Christian Alvestam.

**Personal side note:** I want to share 
something very personal. Just before I wrote this review on Thursday\[4th
 February]. My wife gave birth to a child, but he or she died around the
 11th week. This album will be also kind of In Memoriam for me. On 
Tuesday\[2nd February] she got the news that the child did not have a 
heartbeat. It is kind of taboo to mention something about this, but we 
may and must also bring this to the Lord, the life that was given by Him
 was unfortunately brought to a stop by nature that intervened because 
something was wrong with the development of the child. We will never 
know, but all that I ask for is to pray for us but also for all the 
women and families who also had to go through this.
