I’m always a little apprehensive when I’m asked to review a new metalcore 
release. As much as I love the genre, it has over the last number of 
years become very played out. Am I going to get something spectacular 
and groundbreaking or am I going to be listening to yet another band 
playing the tropes? To be clear, even some of those bands are superbly 
talented, but too much of the same is problematic either way. Enter the 
scene [Defying Death](https://web.facebook.com/defyingdeathva) with their recently released EP **Blinded by Sorrow.**
 The band in their bio claim they are “a fusion of various kinds of 
metal sub-genres that create a sound different from your normal 
metalcore band.” So let us have ourselves a listen and see.

We start the album off with a fairly chill atmospheric intro that slowly 
builds in heaviness as it prepares for a seamless transition in the next
 song. My first couple thoughts here are how pleasant the intro is, an 
interesting counterpoint to what is coming, though it foreshadows how 
the album is going to wrap up. The other thing that jumps out is the 
question of why break up track one and two. The seamless transition 
leads me to believe that it was intended to be a separate song, but for 
some reason was separated after the fact. **Forsaken** is  probably the heaviest and most aggressive song both tonally and musically so I can see why they might have made the change, but the juxtaposition made for a more interesting song.

My main critique of the album aside, **Defying Death**
 is a group of musicians who have clearly practiced a great deal and 
have learned to play incredibly well together. This stands out on **Withered Roots**,
 where the rhythm section holds down the pace of the song, maintaining a
 deep-sounding low end that doesn’t let up. In contrast, their 
guitarists are both doing their own thing while remaining rooted 
(forgive the pun) with the rest of the song. I greatly appreciate the 
subtlety of the lead guitar here; instead of being blaring and in your 
face, it flows nicely just above the rest and ends up being more of an 
atmospheric addition. Until the solo, which is tastefully handled and 
can be appreciated by a noted hater of solos.

The tightness of the band and the two guitarists playing very defined roles gives the 
band the ability to play with different tones to set the mood they are 
going for in each song complimenting the lyrical content. **Withered Roots**
 can transition from a sense of desperation to a passionate plea for 
help. On the other hand, when they went almost exclusively heavy on a 
song, **Lethal Dose**, for example, they cut back on the 
atmosphere and the whole band synchs up and they set an aggressive 
driving pace. This tightness also helps when they end on the 
prerequisite slow song on the album, it’s clearly different from the 
rest but isn’t jarring, it fits nicely with the rest of the album.

**Vocally** the band reminds me of late 90s early 2000s metalcore vocalists. This 
doesn’t have the more polished cleaned-up sound that’s prevalent 
nowadays but uses a rawer stripped-down vocal. It is not quite the more 
buzz saw sound of a Dan Weyandt or Jimmy Ryan, though there are some 
similarities. I do hear a lot of Few Left Standing. It serves the songs 
very well as the lyrics are on the darker side and this really helps to 
set that mood. We even get some higher pitch deathcorish screams, I wish
 were used a little more liberally. **Defying Death** 
doesn’t make a full return to the old metalcore vocal days as they do 
still employ cleans. In a band like this, it’s not unusual for me to be 
annoyed at the cleans and wish for them to just get back to the 
screams/growls. This is not the case here. Every time I hear the chorus 
on **Withered Roots** I am drawn right in and I am fully on
 board for the ride. It’s also not unusual for this chorus to be in my 
head for hours after listening. It’s so catchy. The singing eschews the 
usual whinny emo sound or even the higher-pitched singing. Instead, this
 leans more into what I would equate to a popular Christian hard rock 
sound, though I’m hard-pressed to think of an apt comparison. Again 
typically not something I would enjoy, but I absolutely love how they 
integrate it. The masterful way they sometimes layer the two vocals is 
the cherry on top of the cake.

As I mentioned earlier, the lyrical content of the album is a bit on the dark side. I’m unsure if it’s autobiographical in nature, that is, if one or more of the members 
have struggled with mental illness, suicidal ideation, or the difficulty
 of dealing with a judgmental peer/mentor who doesn’t understand. There 
is a clear sense of frustration and desperation at the seemingly 
never-ending insurmountable struggles. This darkness is punctuated 
throughout with some hopeful sentiments.

**Withered Roots** has a plea for help from God “Take my life back to where you started. Let it all wash back to where your heart is.” While **Isolated Wounds**
 mixes an angry declaration with a statement of freedom “So sick of 
following you. I promise you this time I’ll be the man I want to be.” 
Ultimately we end in a place of surrender “If this is the plan you have 
for me, then God clean my eyes so my heart can finally see what it wants
 to be.” While I’m not a hundred percent certain what it means for the 
heart to see what it wants to be, I get a sense from this album and this
 song in particular, the idea that the narrator realizes despite the 
struggles, God is there, and there is a reason for all of what is 
happening. I like that this doesn’t have the typical happy ending, as 
that isn’t reflective of life. While we don’t always see or understand, 
our suffering and struggle can be and often is used by God and he’s 
there to help us through it all.

Coming back to the original question of how different **Defying Death**
 is from other metalcore and how many influences they have, I’d have to 
say that I don’t necessarily hear that many different metal sounds. That
 being said, they stand out from the pack. A clear commitment to being 
highly proficient in their craft and a practiced tightness allow them to
 subtly experiment and stretch the mold. The mix of old-school vocals 
with contemporary hard rock cleans is an inspired choice. They explore 
dark lyrical concepts with a clear eye to the saving grace of our Lord. I
 would like to see those concepts explored over a few more songs and 
touch more hopefulness, but overall what we get is a great start and I 
will be adding these guys to my follow list.

### Rating: 8/10
