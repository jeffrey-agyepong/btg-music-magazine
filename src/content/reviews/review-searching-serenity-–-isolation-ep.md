Serving straight-up deathcore from Jacksonville, Florida, Searching Serenity brings audio devastation (in a good way) to your ears, and peace through their heartfelt lyrics to your soul! Their Isolation EP was released independently on March 19th, 2020.



**Lyrically:** The EP firmly addresses the sovereignty of the Lord. The lyrics also address that not even Demons can withstand being in His mighty presence. The listener of this EP can find great comfort in the song Never Alone as it expresses the undying love that God has for His people.



**Sonically:** This album is hard-hitting and will not disappoint! The vocalist Robert Manzone unleashes top-notch savagery with his low grinding and sometimes high shrieking vocals. The drums are pounding and steady, and the riffs are stomp worthy! I think they did an excellent job creating such a beautiful atmosphere through the searing riffs and the steady guitar melodies. There is also an awesome acoustic version of Never Alone that is sure to find its way into the heart of the lovers of softer music.



**Favorite Tracks:** The Possession and Never Alone.



The Possession: The EP starts in an earth-shaking manner with blasting drums and a slow, clunky riff that will surely catch the attention of any deathcore fanatic!



**Overall:** This EP is a solid presentation of deathcore. I just love the aggressiveness of it and how they can grab the listener and not let go until the end. I have to say that I’m not a fan of acoustic songs, but the acoustic version of Never Alone was pretty good.

**Rating:** 9.0/10
