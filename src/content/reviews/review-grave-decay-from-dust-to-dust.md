*Grave Decay*
 is a Symphonic Death Metal band from the Netherlands currently 
consisting of Roger Koedoot and Maurice Lefeu. “From Dust to Dust” is 
the bands’ debut album and was released in October of 2018.

This 
album really stands out right from the onset, with pulse-pounding drums 
and symphonic elements that really got me excited to listen to “From 
Dust to Dust.”

**Sound and Mixing**: Throughout this
 album, the mixing is extremely crisp. Guitars shine through, and these 
are definitely the stars of the show next to the lyricism. Shredding 
solos, chunky bridges, and even moments of beautiful strumming are 
definitely the highlights of this album. The drums are fast and heavy 
and keep the songs chugging along at a steady pace, which results in 
music that will take any listener to a completely different place. The 
deep gutturals that sound fantastic, also shine through when teamed up 
with everything else.

**Lyrics**: One aspect of *Grave Decays’*
 “From Dust to Dust” that really makes the album great is the fact that 
every song has a different message. Ranging from words of warning and 
calls to come to Christ, there are also themes of pacificism with the 
anti-war anthem (and my personal favorite off the album) “Boots on The 
Ground.” The song “Grave Mystery” even deals with the existential 
question of “is there a creator of the Earth or is this all just one big
 accident caused by nature?” with the former being what the song alludes
 to. This song is beautifully written, acknowledging all of the aspects 
of Earth and the many creations in it and that surround it. From the 
animals, trees, and humans that inhabit the Earth, to the Sun, Moon, and
 stars that surround us in the universe. The song “Silent Suffering 
(Carolina)” deals with the loss of a loved one, and it was specifically 
written for one of the members’ mothers who had passed away in 2018. 
Anyone that has experienced the deep sense of sorrow that comes with the
 passing of a loved one can relate to the words and theme of this track.
 This only scratches the surface of what *Grave Decay* cover on “From Dust to Dust.”

**Favorites**:
 Personally, “Boots on The Ground” is my number one from this album. It 
tackles the hard truths about war. From being in battle and taking 
someone else’s life to preserve your own or even the men and women that 
are controlling the drones that bomb places, before going home to their 
families. This song by no means takes any sides when it comes to the 
topic of war, with the song ending with a call to come to God. Number 
two for me has to be “Grave Mystery.” This song is beautiful and so full
 of imagery. I would even go as far as to say that it is a happy song. 
Taking in the creation that is Earth and just being appreciative of this
 great gift that we have been given really sheds new light on this album
 and should be explored more in the heavy metal scene as a whole. “Time”
 is a clever track. The band said that this song deals with the passing 
of time and how we spend it, even going as far as to talk about it 
literally. They played with the idea of 60 seconds and 60 minutes as 
well, even going as far as to make the song have a tempo of 60 beats per
 minute. There will be a link at the end of this review with the bands 
website so that people can take a deeper dive into the meanings and 
lyrics of each of these songs. Now for my least favorite on the album. 
“Silent Suffering (Carolina)” is definitely one of the most heartfelt 
songs on the album. As someone who has lost people that were close to me
 in the past, I identified with the emotions behind this song. But we 
are also reminded that there are hope and beauty in loss with the lyric 
“we will meet again.”

**Closing Thoughts and Rating**:
 “From Dust to Dust” excels in multiple areas, but a massive area is in 
the messages that it aims to bring to the listeners. From hope and love 
to calls to end the war and stop the hypocrisy, each song on this album 
is phenomenal.

### Rating: 9/10



**Reason:**
 Each song is well-written and well-worded. The emotions and messages 
are conveyed in non-pretentious ways and it is clear that *Grave Decay* just loves to write heavy music.
