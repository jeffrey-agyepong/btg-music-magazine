Metalcore is an interesting genre for me. It is almost like an umbrella term 
covering a varying array of artists. While I felt the genre hit a 
plateau in the mid-2000s, I feel like it is back on an upswing. Bands 
are starting to either retrace the steps of more aggressive bands before
 them or are pushing the envelope by adding different influences and 
taking a more progressive turn. And this is where we find **mothaltar's** debut EP, **Prologue**.

**Worth Dying** is an instrumental kicking off the EP (an interesting title choice 
considering its opening position). This is a beautifully written intro 
track that just leads you along waiting for what is coming. **The Return**
 delivers when growling vocals and chugging guitars come crashing in 
like a juggernaut. This is, in my opinion, the best song on the EP. The 
song encompasses every piece of the EP without giving too much away. It 
has crushing riffs and brutal vocals all woven in with progressive 
melodic elements and clean singing. The music is matched by thoughtful 
and poetic lyrics. I repeat. This song shows high potential, I could 
listen to it on repeat. Sojourner is a tasty metal groove with just a 
hint of djenty goodness. **Common** takes a bit more of a 
melodic turn, still just a little heavy, but a very well done melody 
sung with clean vocals. It also has an amazing instrumental moment in 
the bridge. The EP ends with **Burning Scoria**, This song starts in an absolutely crushing fashion before wandering off to an ending with spoken word.

Now for negatives, not a whole lot here honestly. **Common** and **Burning Scoria**
 seem to just kind of end out of nowhere. The endings of both kind of 
took me off guard because they just seemed so abrupt. Lyrically there is
 a lot of potentials. The Christian message of the band is definitely 
present, many seem to draw a bridge connecting the struggles of life 
while still finding rest and faith in God. At times, however, the words 
seem to meander around different areas rather than staying fixed on a 
singular idea.

At the end of the day, negatives aside, for a debut EP it's clear that the band isn't slouching. These guys are serious about what they are doing and clearly they want to do it well.  As I have stated, there is some real potential for greatness here, 
especially in **The Return**. With all the progressive feels and melodic experimenting, I would really love to see what this band is capable of. I'd like to see where they can go and what they can do when given more room to let their music breath expand. All in all, it a very solid debut for these guys, and I am interested in watching 
their future.

### Rating: 8/10
